#Acess the dataset from this link: https://github.com/sekilab/VehicleOrientationDataset/tree/main
#You can access our entire final script by loading the ipnyb file, bare in mind our vehicleorientation data set is not included in this repositry as the folder is too large even when compressed.
#You will need the dataset from downloading it from the website above, you need to download part 5. Bare in mind there are 13,500 pictures which are approx 6GB
